MGRS Tools
=====================

Tools to use MGRS coordinates in QGIS

The plugin contains 2 tools:

- Zoom to coordinate
- MGRS map tool

To use the map tool, select the *MGRS map tool* item in the MGRS tools menu. 

The map tool will get activated. When you now move your mouse ove the QGIS map canvas, the MGRS coordinates corresponding to the mouse position will be displayed in the QGIS status bar

The zoom coordinate allows you to zoom to a given MGRS coordinate. The coordinate can be a full one with 1m precision level 1m, or a shorter one representing a lower precision level.

About the mgrs library
-----------------------

The plugin uses the mgrs library, which itself requires native libraries to perform the lat-lon to MGRS conversions. This repo has by default a compiled library for working in Win32 platforms. If you plan to use a different platform, you should compile the native libraries yourself and use them for installing the plugin in your QGIS plugins folder.

The precision of the conversion is affected by the precision of the MGRS system itself, and the library does not guarantee that a coordinate conversion back and forth will render the same initial coordinate, as shown in the next example: Taking a as starting coordinate latitude = 42.0, longitude = -93.0, it gives an MGRS coordinate of '15TWG0000049776' (using the full precision in this case). When converting that into lat/lon again, it returns (41.999997975127997, -93.000000000000014)
